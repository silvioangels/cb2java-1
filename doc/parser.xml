  <title>Working with parsed Copybooks</title>

  <para>The Copybook class, while primarily used to parse application 
  data, can also be used to build generators or for any other 
  introspective task related to the copybook.</para>

  <para>The base type for the parse tree is the Element class.  There are a good number of Element
  types, one for each unique COBOL type.  This means that while there is a separate type for Binary
  vs. Packed types, there is no type for COMP vs. BINARY.  The different types and how they relate
  back to the COBOL types is detailed in the JavaDocs for these classes (or will be anyway.)</para>

  <para>Like the Data types, the Element types are groiped into two major types: Leaf and Group.  
  Leaf elements are associated with values a Group types with, well, groups.  The element tree will
  essentially mirror the Data tree except that the Element had much more information relating to the
  actual COBOL types in the copybook definition.  The
